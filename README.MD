# Project Description
Creating an app can be a time consuming task and you should be able to devote as much time to it as possible without having to worry about any other additional steps. Therefore, the professional README generator will generate a README for you in the command line. To invoke the app, you simple have to type 'node index.js' in your terminal. The user will answer a list of prompts, such as the project name, description, install instructions, usage, contributors, tests, liscenses, and their contact information. Then the application will generate a README file for them.
